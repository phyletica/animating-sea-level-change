Sea-level estimates are from the projection of
[Spratt and Lisiecki (2016)](https://www.clim-past.net/12/1079/2016/).
These data are included in the repository and can be found here:

The bathymetry data are from the ETOPO1 1-arc-minute global relief model
([Amante and Eakins, 2009](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/global/relief/ETOPO1/docs/ETOPO1.pdf)),
